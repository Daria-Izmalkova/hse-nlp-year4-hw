"Social scientists are increasingly interested in beliefs about farm animal well-being and the factors that predict these beliefs. Yet little attention has been given to the role of values, which social psychologists consider to be the building blocks of human cognition. This study draws from research on values in the environmental social sciences to examine the relationship between environmental values and Americans’ beliefs about farm animal well-being. It also makes a methodological contribution by demonstrating the importance of measuring beliefs about farm animal well-being on large industrial and small family farms separately. A series of paired sample t-tests finds Americans believe the well-being of farm animals on large industrial farms is significantly worse than on small family farms. Multiple regression results reveal the importance of environmental values, as well as various demographic factors, in understanding beliefs about farm animal well-being. They also suggest the presence of direct and indirect effects of values on beliefs. Implications and avenues for further research are discussed.","Environmental values, Animal well-being, Farm animals, Animal agriculture, Animal welfare","farm animals, animal well-being, environmental values, beliefs",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350444548_Environmental_values_and_Americans'_beliefs_about_farm_animal_well-being
"The main aim of this article is to start a discussion of social pattern, a term that is commonly used in sociology but not speciﬁed or deﬁned. The key question can be phrased as follows: Is it possible to transform the notion of social pattern from its current status in sociology as a proto-concept into a fully worked out concept? And if so, how can this be done? To provide material for the discussion we begin by introducing a few diﬀerent types of patterns that are currently being used (patterns in nature, cultural patterns, statistical patterns, and computationally generated patterns). This is followed by a suggestion for what a strictly sociological concept of social pattern may look like. A useful and theoretically solid concept of social pattern can in our view be constructed by basing it on Weber’s concept of social action. This means that both the behavior of the actors and the meaning these invest their behavior with must be taken into account. The article ends with a brief discussion of how to use the concept of social patterns in an eﬀective way and what may endanger such a use.","Computational social science, Cultural pattern, Pattern, Regularities, Social action, Social pattern, Statistical pattern","social pattern, pattern, sociology",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355201752_What_is_a_social_pattern_Rethinking_a_central_social_science_term
"Integrating the dynamics and interconnections of natural and human system properties into a single measure would make it simpler to reliably and repeatedly assess and compare different social-environmental systems (SES). We propose a novel metric to assess the magnitudes and variations in SES dynamics by integrating longitudinal gross domestic product, population, and ecosystem net primary production. We use annual public data across the Asian Drylands Belt (ADB) from 1992 through 2016 for 18 political entities as our testbed for assessing the efficacy of the metric. We perform cross-comparisons with existing natural and social science metrics to demonstrate the validity of the proposed metric, including the Human Development Index and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. The new metric demonstrates notable and meaningful differences in trends among the political entities that reflect major social, economic and environmental events over the 25-year period. It provides unique perspectives about the three pillar components (social, economic and environmental systems) in each of the 18 political entities (PE) of the ADB. The metric also shows meaningful associations with key economic and environmental indicators and great potential for broader application and evaluation, given additional testing in other countries, regions, and biomes.","Asian Drylands Belt, social‐environmental system, quantitative measure, sustainability","social-environmental system, SES, Asian Drylands Belt, ADB",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355185490_Towards_a_Single_Integrative_Metric_on_the_Dynamics_of_Social-Environmental_Systems
"Citizen science research has been rapidly expanding in the past years and has become a popular approach in youth education. We investigated key drivers of youth participation in a citizen social science school project and the effects of participation on scientific and topic-related (i.e., political) interest and efficacy. Findings suggest that females, more politically and scientifically interested and more scientifically efficacious adolescents were more motivated to learn from the project. Science efficacy was also positively related to external reward motivation (i.e., winning an award). Both learning and external reward motivation increased the likelihood of participation. Pre- and post-measurement further indicated that participation in the project slightly increased science interest, but not science efficacy. However, it did increase both political interest and efficacy. Furthermore, our data revealed a decrease in science efficacy and interest in those who did not participate in the project, indicating an increasing gap in adolescents’ scientific involvement.","citizen science, political engagement, education, young people","youth, citizen science, science efficacy, political interest",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355192919_Citizen_Science_in_Schools_Predictors_and_Outcomes_of_Participating_in_Voluntary_Political_Research
"This research aims to investigate the potential of consumer empowerment, the activation of consumers' perceived power over companies, to achieve improved advertising effects for organic food compared to only communicating ecological benefits (classical green appeals). Two online experiments were conducted to analyze the ad effectiveness for consumers' responses including their evaluations of the company and purchase intentions (n Study1 = 294; n Study2 = 457). Results indicate that green empowerment ads reach overall better performance to increase people's perceived customer orientation and purchase intentions compared to green appeals, while similar effects are identified for perceived corporate environmental responsibility. Empowerment tactics are especially effective when consumers perceive the supplier to be a larger, high-resource company compared to a smaller, low-resource one. The significant effects of perceived corporate resources also indicates that smaller companies should use differentiated ad strategies depending on if they intend to enhance consumers' purchase intentions or their environmental reputation.","Green advertisement, Consumer empowerment, Customer orientation, Organic food","consumer empowerment, organic food, green ads, advertisement, purchase intentions",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355058395_The_effects_of_green_consumer_empowerment_in_advertising_on_corporate_evaluations_and_purchase_intention_the_case_of_organic_food
"Recognition of others' identity through facial features is essential in life. Using both correlational and experimental approaches, we examined how person knowledge biases the perception of others' facial identity. When a participant believed any two individuals were more similar in personality, their faces were perceived to be correspondingly more similar (assessed via mousetracking, Study 1). Further, participants' facial representations of target individuals that were believed to have a more similar personality were found to have a greater physical resemblance (assessed via reverse-correlation, Studies 2 and 3). Finally, when participants learned about novel individuals who had a more similar personality, their faces were visually represented more similarly (Study 4). Together, the findings show that the perception of facial identity is driven not only by facial features but also the person knowledge we have learned about others, biasing it toward alternate identities despite the fact that those identities lack any physical resemblance.","person perception, face processing, semantic memory, mouse tracking, reverse correlation","perception, person knowledge, facial features, identity",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354199851_Person_knowledge_shapes_face_identity_perception
"Evidence suggests parents of children who experience a trauma may develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which can have significant consequences for their own and their child’s functioning. As such, identifying the rates and possible correlates for the development of PTSD in parents is of clinical and theoretical importance, and would enhance our understanding of how best to support families in the aftermath of trauma. This meta-analysis of 41 studies ( n = 4370) estimated the rate of PTSD in parents following their child’s single-incident trauma to be 17.0% (95% CI 14.1–20.0%); when removing samples which were mixed, or not exclusively single-incident traumas the prevalence estimate dropped to 14.4% (95% CI 10.8–18.5%). Pooled effect sizes of 32 potential correlates for parents developing PTSD were also identified. Medium-to-large effects were found for factors relating to the parent’s post-traumatic cognition, psychological functioning and coping strategies alongside child PTSD. Small effects were found for pre-trauma factors, objective trauma-related variables and demographic factors for both parent and child. Results are consistent with cognitive models of PTSD, suggesting peri- and post-trauma factors are likely to play a substantial role in its development. These findings indicate the clinical need for screening parents most vulnerable to adverse post-traumatic reactions within the context of child trauma and tailoring interventions to include the family where necessary.","Post-traumatic stress disorder, Prevalence, Risk factor, Parents, Children, Predictor","post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, parents, children",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354801883_Post-traumatic_Stress_Disorder_in_Parents_Following_Their_Child's_Single-Event_Trauma_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Prevalence_Rates_and_Risk_Factor_Correlates
"Current theories of artificial intelligence (AI) generally exclude human emotions. The idea at the core of such theories could be described as ‘cognition is computing’; that is, that human psychological and symbolic representations and the operations involved in structuring such representations in human thinking and intelligence can be converted by AI into a series of cognitive symbolic representations and calculations in a manner that simulates human intelligence. However, after decades of development, the cognitive computing doctrine has encountered many difficulties, both in theory and in practice; in particular, it is far from approaching real human intelligence. Real human intelligence runs through the whole process of the emotions. The core and motivation of rational thinking are derived from the emotions. Intelligence without emotion neither exists nor is meaningful. For example, the idea of ‘hot thinking’ proposed by Paul Thagard, a philosopher of cognitive science, discusses the mechanism of the emotions in human cognition and the thinking process. Through an analysis from the perspectives of cognitive neurology, cognitive psychology and social anthropology, this article notes that there may be a type of thinking that could be called ‘emotional thinking’. This type of thinking includes complex emotional factors during the cognitive processes. The term is used to refer to the capacity to process information and use emotions to integrate information in order to arrive at the right decisions and reactions. This type of thinking can be divided into two types according to the role of cognition: positive and negative emotional thinking. That division reflects opposite forces in the cognitive process. In the future, ‘emotional computing’ will cause an important acceleration in the development of AI consciousness. The foundation of AI consciousness is emotional computing based on the simulation of emotional thinking.","emotion, thinking, emotional thinking, AI consciousness, emotional computing","artificial intelligence, ai, intelligence, emotional thinking, cognition",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355675751_Perceptions_of_AI_engaging_in_human_expression
"When we say that what two people feel for each other is 'true love,' we seem to be doing more than simply clarifying that it is in fact love they feel, as opposed to something else. That is, an experience or relationship might be a genuine or actual instance of love without necessarily being an instance of true love. But what criteria do people use to determine whether something counts as true love? This chapter explores three hypotheses. The first holds that the ordinary concept of true love picks out love that is highly prototypical. The second, that it picks out love that is especially good or valuable. The third, that people distinguish between psychological states that are 'real' or not, and that it picks out love that is real. Two experiments provide evidence against the first hypothesis and in favor of the second and third. Implications for real-life disagreements about love are also discussed.","true love, ordinary concept, prototype, goodness, realness, experiments","true love, love",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348691138_The_Ordinary_Concept_of_True_Love
"During the last decade, intellectual humility has gone from a topic of philosophical inquiry to one of serious scientific investigation. It has been variously described as a remedy for political polarization, a tool for advancing scientific credibility, and a disposition that promotes learning. However, less attention has been paid to how intellectual humility has been defined and measured or how well psychologists’ definitions and measures align with one another or with philosophers’ accounts. Through a systematic review of empirical intellectual humility research, we identified 18 separate definitions and 20 measures including 16 unique questionnaires. We then synthesized this research to advance a new framework of intellectual humility. Implications of this framework for measurement and future research on intellectual humility are discussed.","Intellectual humility, Measurement, Intellectual virtue, Jingle-jangle fallacies, Wisdom","intellectual humility, definition, measurement",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354889994_Clarifying_the_Content_of_Intellectual_Humility_A_Systematic_Review_and_Integrative_Framework
"The ending effect describes the phenomenon that at the end of a series of repeated risky decision- making tasks, participants become more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior. Past research has suggested that the ending effect might be caused by a motivational shift induced by changes in time perception. Previous studies mainly tested this phenomenon in a binary decision-making setting (e.g., a decision-making task usually includes two alternatives). However, none of these prior studies included a safe option and risky options that differed in risk levels. To address this gap in knowledge, the present work replicated the ending effect in a repeated decision-making task that included both a safe option and risky options that differed in risk levels (N = 104). We found that at the end of the decision-making task, participants became more likely to engage in risk-taking and to favor the option with the highest risk. Further, we found that the investment likelihood and investment amount of high-risk options both increased significantly at the ending. We also found that the emotional motivation in the last round could predict the increased preference for high-risk at the ending. This work extends previous findings on the ending effect by adopting a more complex decision-making scenario and, more broadly, helps further our understanding of the psychological consequences of perceived endings.","ending effect, motivation, risky decision making, socioemotional selectivity theory, longshot","ending effect, decision-making, risk",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354826179_Longshot_or_Favorite_The_Ending_Effect_in_Investment_Decisions
"The past few decades have seen a substantial increase in the focus on the myriad ethical implications of artificial intelligence. Included amongst the numerous issues is the existential risk that some believe could arise from the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) which is an as-of-yet hypothetical form of AI that is able to perform all the same intellectual feats as humans. This has led to extensive research into how humans can avoid losing control of an AI that is at least as intelligent as the best of us. This ‘control problem’ has given rise to research into the development of ‘friendly AI’ which is a highly competent AGI that will benefit, or at the very least, not be hostile toward humans. Though my question is focused upon AI, ethics and issues surrounding the value of friendliness, I want to question the pursuit of human-friendly AI (hereafter FAI). In other words, we might ask whether worries regarding harm to humans are sufficient reason to develop FAI rather than impartially ethical AGI, or an AGI designed to take the interests of all moral patients—both human and non-human—into consideration. I argue that, given that we are capable of developing AGI, it ought to be developed with impartial, species-neutral values rather than those prioritizing friendliness to humans above all else.","Artiﬁcial intelligence, Artiﬁcial general intelligence, Superintelligence, Existential risk, Control problem, Impartiality, Friendly AI","artificial intelligence, ai, artificial general intelligence, agi, friendly ai, fai",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351447177_Two_arguments_against_human-friendly_AI
"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their fields of application are among the most debated developments of recent times. Although being widely discussed academically, publicly and in policy debates, certain aspects of their research, development and application are completely ignored, namely the impact AI has on animals. Animals are affected by the research on and development of this technology since it partially relies on animal testing. In addition, AI is also being applied to improve monitoring and marketing of animals in an agricultural context. We argue that it is insufficient to exclude these aspects from debates around AI. In addition to the surveillance-applications on animals, which can be evaluated as impacting them negatively, AI applications, from which individual animals can benefit, do exist. These can primarily be found in nature and wildlife conservation, as we point out at the end of the paper. By providing an overview on how these technologies are applied to animals and how this affects them, this paper aims to fill a previously existing research gap.","Artifcial intelligence, Machine learning, Animal experiments, Animal ethics, AI for Conservation","artificial intelligence, ai, animals",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353739972_Animals_and_AI_The_role_of_animals_in_AI_research_and_application_-_An_overview_and_ethical_evaluation
"Consumer resistance is a major barrier to diffusing radical innovation into mainstream markets. While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brand in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial-Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self–brand connection and brand concept literatures to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self–brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self–brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self–brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers’ self–brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3).","artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, brand concept, innovation, self‐brand connection","consumer resistance, artificial intelligence, ai, self-brand connection",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351065931_The_Role_of_Brands_in_Overcoming_Consumer_Resistance_to_Autonomous_Vehicles
"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic leading to over 180 million confirmed cases and nearly 4 million deaths until June, 2021, according to the World Health Organization. Since the initial reported from December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has demonstrated a high transmission rate (with a R0 > 2), a diverse set of clinical characteristics (e.g., high rate of hospital and intensive care unit admission rates, multi-organ dysfunction for critically ill patients due to hyperinflammation, thrombosis, etc.), and tremendous burden on health care systems around the world. To understand the serious and complex disease and develop effective control, treatment, and prevention strategies, researchers from different disciplines have been making significant efforts from different aspects including epidemiology and public health, biology and genomic medicine, as well as clinical care and patient management. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced into the healthcare field to aid clinical decision-making for disease diagnosis and treatment such as detecting cancer based on medical images and has achieved superior performance in multiple data-rich application scenarios. In the COVID-19 pandemic, AI techniques have also been used as a powerful tool to overcome the complex disease. In this context, the goal of this study is to review existing studies on applications of AI techniques in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, these efforts can be grouped into the fields of epidemiology, therapeutics, clinical research, social and behavioral studies and are summarized. Potential challenges, directions, and open questions are discussed accordingly, which may provide new insights into addressing COVID-19 pandemic and would be helpful for researchers to explore more related topics in the post-pandemic era.","COVID-19 pandemic, Artificial intelligence, Electronic health record, Machine learning","covid-19 pandemic, covid-19, artificial intelligence, ai",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355476836_AI_for_COVID-19_Battling_the_pandemic_with_computational_intelligence
"In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies, have been progressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a data-driven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC.","food supply chain, computational intelligence, fish farming, agriculture, livestock, machinelearning, neural networks, deep learning, meta-heuristics, fuzzy systems, probabilistic methods","food supply chain, fsc, computational intelligence, ci",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355381994_A_Taxonomy_of_Food_Supply_Chain_Problems_from_a_Computational_Intelligence_Perspective
